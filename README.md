# Personal Portfolio

Hello all! Looks like you have landed on my portfolio github and I thank you for that!

## Motivation

My motivation behind this is to showcase my projects to world and allow users to demo what my skills can bring to the table, though what I have created personally does not reflect my full potential as I surprise myself everyday with what I can create.

I created this personal project utilizing JavaScript no framework which allows me always practice my JavaScript skills. I have been able to create my own smooth scrolling slider, carsouel slider, modal per project and much more.

## Tech Stack

    - Html
    - CSS3
    - JavaScript
